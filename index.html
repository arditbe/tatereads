                      Shame is a fantastic motivator.

                      That is why The Matrix works its best to remove it from Society.
                      
                      Fat? You're Beautiful.
                      
                      Want to cut off your penis and rob your parents of having grandchildren? That's Brave.
                      
                      They've removed Shame and now there are full-grown men acting like clowns publicly displaying their downfall to try and get some views.
                      
                      Did you feel DEEP shame when you cucked and got vaccinated?
                      
                      DEEP shame when you put on the mask like a little bitch because you were afraid?
                      
                      DEEP shame when you jerked off and looked in the mirror at your weak pathetic excuse for a body?
                      
                      You don't have enough shame in your life.
                      
                      I look at you and IT LITERALLY COULDN'T BE ME.
                      
                      I would be ASHAMED to walk outside.
                      
                      I'd be too ashamed of myself to even speak my opinion.
                      
                      Do you not understand?
                      
                      I COULD NOT BE YOU.
                      
                      I could not miss training.
                      
                      Missing training would HURT me deep inside. A sensation of shame that would haunt me for MONTHS.
                      
                      I became 4x World Champion because I would bring SHAME ON MY ENTIRE BLOODLINE IF I DID NOT.
                      
                      I became the most influential man on earth, cracking the Matrix, TRYING MY BEST TO FREE YOU FROM YOUR SELF-INDUCED CAGE.
                      
                      I would be ASHAMED otherwise.
                      
                      You feel no shame.
                      
                      You don't REALLY care that you're a nobody.
                      
                      It doesn't bother you in your core.
                      
                      You will waste your life, the one life on earth you are given.
                      
                      You will WASTE IT.
                      
                      You will watch TRAGEDY BEFALL YOUR FAMILY AND BE TOO WEAK TO SAVE THEM.
                      
                      You will do all this,
                      
                      And never even feel any shame.
                      
                      That is why you don't have "motivation" to do anything great.
                      
                      That is why you will never become great.
                      
                      Sometimes in life, you don't need to be motivated by what you get when you win.
                      
                      I'd argue you would find much more motivation if you felt the STING of shame like I do.
                      
                      Training is hard, it hurts.
                      
                      The shame of missing training hurts much more deeply.
                      
                      I can't miss a day.
                      
                      The consequences are too severe.
                      
                      You don't even care.

                      Maybe you have exactly what you deserve.

                      Has it crossed your mind that all of the things you want, yet do not have - you simply do not deserve?
                      
                      You've yet to earn them?
                      
                      REALLY wanting something isn't the same as earning something.
                      
                      I can really want a 6 pack while I eat donuts, try me. 
                      
                      You confuse wanting things with effort.
                       
                      Confuse wanting things with pure directional FORCE.
                      
                      You must DO SO MUCH that the universe HAS to give you something.
                      
                      I know men who are rich by accident. They didn't even want money.
                      
                      I know fighters who are millionaires and when people ask them about money they say 
                      
                      "I don't care about money, I just wanted to fight".
                      
                      They got rich without even trying, they were provided with something they didn't really want (money) because PURE ACTION can only lead to PURE RESULT.
                      
                      These men trained like ANIMALS.
                       
                      EVERY SINGLE DAY.
                      
                      DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
                      
                      WANTING SOMETHING is not ACTION.
                      
                      What are you DOING to get it?
                      
                      And if you were TRULY DOING enough, you would have it.
                      
                      Logic dictates you have what you deserve.
                       
                      You have no less or no more than what should be returned to you via Newton’s third law.
                      
                      For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
                      
                      I, Emory Andrew Tate the 3rd, have more than you.
                      
                      More power. More stamina. More skill. More money. More cars. More resolve. More love. More intellect. More of EVERYTHING.
                      
                      Why?
                      
                      Because I have TRIED harder than you.
                      
                      I DID more than you.
                      
                      And it is only FAIR that the universe GIVES me more than you.
                      
                      You deserve less than me. 
                      
                      Understand this...
                      
                      TO HAVE MORE.
                       
                      You must DO more.
                      
                      Stop wasting time.
                      
                      DO MORE.

                      You play the game because you want to win.

                      I play the game because I enjoy it.
                      
                      That is why you are shit in comparison.
                      
                      If I gave you ONE BILLION DOLLARS, genuinely ask yourself.
                      
                      Would you risk it all to try to turn it into two Billion?
                      
                      Any answer other than yes guarantees you do not have the mindset to make 1 Billion in the first place.
                      
                      You just want to win.
                      
                      You don't want the stress.
                      
                      YOU DON'T ENJOY THE GAME.
                      
                      A judge just stole 55 BILLION dollars from Elon Musk.
                      
                      Do you think he's distraught?
                      
                      Annoyed, sure.
                      
                      But he's busy putting rockets into space.
                      
                      Would the 55 Billion have helped? Yes.
                      
                      Will he try to get his rightful money back? Of course.
                      
                      But WHY does he want the money? To retire? No.
                      
                      He wants to use it to play the game more.
                      
                      Use the 55 Billion to further accelerate his progress through the game of life.
                      
                      This is what you don't have.
                      
                      This is what all the Crypto losers don't have.
                      
                      You aren't trying to get rich because you enjoy the process of getting rich.
                      
                      If I gave you 1 Billion dollars, you'd lose most of it and spend the rest to continue your meager worm-like existence unimpeded.
                      
                      No more working,
                      
                      No more training.
                      
                      You THINK you'd train, hire a personal chef and a trainer.
                      
                      YOU THINK that if you didn't have to go to work or school you'd be MOTIVATED to make something of yourself.
                      
                      But the truth is that you are lazy.
                      
                      You don't want to do hard things.
                      
                      You want to be strong and rich but you don't ENJOY the process to get there.
                      
                      You came to Win.
                      
                      I came to Fight.
                      
                      I will play the game even if I will probably lose.
                      
                      You wouldn't play at all.
                      
                      That's why I will always beat you in the end.

                      The technological and social changes in 2023 were significant. 

                      But 2024 will bring even more drastic change.
                      
                      And 2025 will bring even more change than 2024.
                      
                      You need to understand that the world is accelerating.
                      
                      The changes that required a decade to implement in times of old, now happen in a matter of days. 
                      
                      You need to understand that what worked BEFORE won't work TODAY.
                      
                      In the older days, ways of making money would take a few years to expire. 
                      
                      Let me tell you - 
                      
                      I had ways of generating income last month which no longer work. 
                      
                      A few short weeks and the money has dried up. 
                      
                      The entire game is different. 
                      
                      You have to get in fast. 
                      
                      Act quick. 
                      
                      Milk the cow. 
                      
                      Mine all the gold. 
                      
                      And vanish when the brokies turn up looking for scraps. 
                      
                      The rules of earth keep changing and the opportunities are changing even faster.
                      
                      The men who win are the men who adapt the quickest.

                      2024! NEW YEAR!
                      
                      Do you remember all the commitments you made to yourself?
                      
                      The promises?
                      
                      I'm on my 1129th day since I made the commitment to train every single day without rest.
                      
                      What day are you on for your commitments?
                      
                      Remember when you said you were not going to scroll social media anymore?
                      
                      Remember the daily training you were supposed to still be doing?
                      
                      Remember how you were going to stop fucking up and finally take life seriously?
                      
                      WHY DID YOU STOP??
                      
                      It's not even been 5 weeks.
                      
                      NOT EVEN 35 DAYS HAVE PASSED.
                      
                      And you just give up?
                      
                      BECAUSE IT’S HARD???
                      
                      Does your word mean so little?
                      
                      I understand that you have excuses, what I do not understand is why you don't just stick to your commitments anyway.
                      
                      Do you think the day I got my house raided and thrown into a cell that I missed that day’s training?
                      
                      You will read this post and you will give yourself another excuse for why breaking your own promise to yourself was justified.
                      
                      And that's why you will stay poor and miserable forever.
                      
                      And when you read this post, there are two different reactions you can have.
                      
                      1) Continue breaking your 2024 commitments to yourself, justify it and make excuses for why you will remain a worthless worm.
                      
                      2) Get back to daily training, back to the daily SUFFERING and make yourself proud.
                      
                      CHOOSE.

                      You make important decisions.
                      
                      As THE REAL WORLD's power continues to grow and we continue to shape earth.
                      
                      I've decided to make THE COUNCIL.
                      
                      The goal of THE COUNCIL is to make sure we are using our power as effectively as possible.
                      
                      Life is a hierarchy.
                      
                      If you are a student who has completely changed your life, if you are the type of student who worked harder, trained harder and DID more.
                      
                      You deserve to have a position of power inside of it.
                      
                      THE COUNCIL will be a group of people who are directly involved in the developmental directions THE REAL WORLD takes.
                      
                      It allows you to DM and build relationships with other members,
                      
                      To influence where our world-class tech team should take the app next.
                      
                      Working side by side with your Professors to further increase THE REAL WORLD student success.
                      
                      Surround yourself with THE BEST students that THE REAL WORLD has to offer.
                      
                      As we continue to grow,
                      
                      As we continue to change lives,
                      
                      As we continue to change the world.
                      
                      THE COUNCIL will be there to guide you every step of the way.
                      
                      Applications open in 24 hours.

                      I do it.
                      It's called being a responsible adult.
                      I train everyday so I stay strong.
                      I make money everyday so I can enjoy every day with complete freedom.
                      I am exceptionally disciplined.
                      The only “motivation” is that I don’t want to end up like you.
